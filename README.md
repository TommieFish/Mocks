# MockCodeTimeline

## Overview
**MockCodeTimeline** is a repository created to track and document all changes made to code provided in advance for a mock assessment.  
Used is to clearly show how errors are identified, fixed, and improved, while keeping a structured record of answers and independent coding tasks.

This repository acts as:
- A **timeline of edits**
- A **record of error fixes**
- A **revision and reflection tool**
- A **portfolio of mock assessment work**

## Repository Structure

### 📁 Preliminary Material
This folder contains the original code provided before the mock.

- The commit history will act as a **timeline of corrections**

Purpose:
- Track debugging progress
- Show understanding of the code
- Demonstrate problem-solving skills

### 📁 Section C && D
This section focuses on **answering questions about the provided code**.

- Answers relate directly to the Preliminary Material
- Fixes made in response to questions will be:
  - Clearly visible in the code
  - Reflected in commit messages
    
- Additional code will be displayed where the code should go
